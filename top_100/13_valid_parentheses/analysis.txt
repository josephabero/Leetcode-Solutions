https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/

Optimal:
	Use a dictionary/hashmap to save open/closed bracket pairs.
	Use a stack to keep track of order of brackets.

	Once closed bracket is found, pop and verify the open bracket is the matching bracket.

	Edge cases:
		- More open brackets than closing brackets
		- More closing brackets than open brackets

	Time: O(n)
	Space: O(n)
