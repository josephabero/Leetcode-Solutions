Decode String
https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/

Optimal:
	Use stack to maintain order of characters between nested brackets.
	If we find a closing bracket (']'), then we know we need to decode string.
	As we iterate through, if it is not a closing bracket, we simply add to stack.

	When we hit a closing bracket, we:
		1. Pop all of the characters within the brackets (maintain original order)
		2. Pop all of the numbers before the opening bracket (maintain original order)
			- Must consider numbers with multiple digits ("54[ab]")

	At the end, iterate through stack and add to the result string.

	Time: O(2n) = O(n)
	Space: O(n)
