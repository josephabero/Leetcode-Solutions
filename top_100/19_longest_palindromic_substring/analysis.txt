Longest Palindromic Substring
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring

Brute Force:
	Iterate over every substring, then check if the substring is a palindrome.

	Finding every combination of substring: O(n^2)
	Checking if substring is palindrome: O(n)
		- Using 2 pointers, start from outside indices and check if equal.

	Time: O(n^3)
	Space: O(1)

Optimal:
	* Dynamic Programming *

	Iterate through each character in substring and expand from the center.
	Check if surrounding characters make a substring.
		- Must consider both EVEN and ODD palindromes.

	Time: O(n^2)
	Space: O(1)
