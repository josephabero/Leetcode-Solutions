Maximum Subarray
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/

Brute Force:
    Iterate through each combination and add up all numbers within subarray.

    Time: O(n^3)
    Space: O(1)

    Small optimization, iterate through each combination and keep current sum as you iterate through.

    Time: O(n^2)
    Space: O(1)

Optimal:
    Iterate through with 2 pointers, each number and keep current sum as you iterate.

    If new index is a positive number and is prefixed by a negative sum, skip negative sum and restart current count.

    Time: O(n)
    Space: O(1)
