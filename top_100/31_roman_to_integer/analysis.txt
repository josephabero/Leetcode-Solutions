Roman to Integer
https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/

Optimal:
	Use a hashmap to store the roman numeral to integer pairs.
	Iterate through input string, add up numerals from left to right.

	2 keys of info:
		1. Roman Numerals decrease left to right
		2. Have to handle case where smaller Roman Numeral preceding a larger one results in subtraction:
			"IV": 5 - 1
			"XC": 100 - 10

		Could store every combination in the hashmap, but that's too many to realistically add.
		There can only be 1 numeral preceding a larger one, therefore, can simple look ahead to the next character and see if we need to subtract.
