Sqrt(x)
https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/

Brute Force:
	Calculate products starting from the index 0.
	Try up to when product is equal to or larger than given x.
	If equal, return index. If larger, return index - 1.

	Time: O(n^2)
	Space: O(1)

Optimal:
	Perform binary search to decrease the search space.
	Try products for midpoint index.
	If product is larger, check left side.
	If product is smaller, check right side AND save product in case it is the result.
	Time: O(log(n))
	Space: O(1)
