Two Sum:
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum

Brute Force:
	Two pointers, iterate through all possible combinations until solution is found.

	Time: O(n^2)
	Space: O(1)

Optimal:
	Use hashmap to keep track of value, index pairs as you iterate through list.
	Allows solution to be found through 1 pass of the list.

	Time: O(n)
	Space: O(n)
