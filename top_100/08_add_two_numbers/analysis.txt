Optimal:
	Iterate over both inputs lists together.
	Calculate sum of values.
		- Determine and save if there is carry
	Create node and only save ones place.
	Increment node pointers.

	Consider:
		- If there is leftover carry, continue the loop to create new 1 node
		- If list ends, consider value of node as 0

	Time: O(n)
	Space: O(1)
