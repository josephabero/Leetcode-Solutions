Search in Rotated Sorted Array
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/

Optimal:
	Perform binary search to acheive log(n) time complexity.
		- Use 3 pointers: left, middle, right

	Add conditional checks to take into account rotation:
		1. Check validity of value ranges in sorted array:
			- Left < Middle
			- Middle < Right
		2. If a valid section, check if target is within range, if not, then check other side

	Time: O(log(n))
	Space: O(1)
