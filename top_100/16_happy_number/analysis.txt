Optimal:
	Update input n to new number and calculate sum of the squares for input.

	Use set to keep track of already calculated sum of squares.

	If sum == 1 or sum is in set, then break.

	n is the number of iterations required.
	m is the max length of the calculated sum

	Time: O(n)
	Space: O(m)
