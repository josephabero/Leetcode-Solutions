Merge Intervals
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals

Optimal:
	Sort intervals by starting value so that we can iterate through cleanly.
	Create result list and add intervals as we iterate through.
	Merge intervals which overlap.

	Must consider cases where the following intervals are within interals already stored.
	Example:
		[1,4] and [2,3]

		The result should be [1,4]

	Time: O(nlog(n) + n) = O(nlog(n))
	Space: O(n)
