Number of Islands
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands

Optimal:
	Iterate over each node in the matrix and perform graph traversal with BFS/DFS for each node containing the value of "1". Use a set to keep track of visited nodes as you perform BFS/DFS.

	As we iterate through each node, if the value is "1" and the node hasn't been visited yet, then we have found a new island. Therefore, perform BFS and increase the count for number of islands.

	Time: O(n * m)
	Space: O(n * m)
