Move Zeroes
https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/

Brute Force:
	Iterate through list, if zero is found, remove the zero and append it to the end.
	This requires the use of the `pop()` function which is O(n).

	Time: O(n^2)
	Space: O(1)

Optimal:
	Use fast and slow pointer.
	Fast pointer iterates through list. Slow pointer will keep track of 0 that must be moved to the right of the list.

	As we iterate, we swap 0s with the left-most non-zero number and repeat until all zeroes are moved to the right of the list.

	Time: O(n)
	Space: O(1)
