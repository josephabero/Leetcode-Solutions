https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

Optimal:
	Use 2 pointers: left and right.
	Left is the start of the list, right points to the end.

	Calculate the area of the container using these two pointers.
	If it is the largest so far, save the product.
	Advance the pointer which has the smaller value of the two.
	Repeat until pointers meet.

	Time: O(n)
	Space: O(1)
