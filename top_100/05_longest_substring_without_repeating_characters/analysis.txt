Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters

Optimal:
	Use 2 pointers: left and right.
	Initialize left and right pointers to 0 index.
	Use set of strings to keep track of current substring.
	Keep track of largest substring.

	Iterate through all characters with right index.
		If right character exists within set, increment left pointer until character is removed.
		(This operation is O(1) since we are using a set for the substring)
	Add right character to set, update max count if necessary.

	Time: O(n)
	Space: O(n)
