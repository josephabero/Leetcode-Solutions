Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation

Optimal:
	Use 1 list for stack.
	Iterate through all tokens:
		If integer (positive or negative), add to stack.
		If operator, pop the last 2 integers from stack & evaluate result.
			Add result to stack.

	Able to make assumptions because input string is always valid.

	Time: O(2n) = O(n)
	Space: O(n)
