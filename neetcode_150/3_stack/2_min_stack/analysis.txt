https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack

Optimal:
	Each stack operation must be O(1).
	Use 2 lists: stack and minimum stack.
	Keep track of minimum values at each index of the stack.
		Whenever there is a "push" or "pop", append and pop from minimum stack
		as well.

	Time: O(1)
	Space: O(2n)= O(n)
