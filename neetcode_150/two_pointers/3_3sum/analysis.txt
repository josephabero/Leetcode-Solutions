3Sum
https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum

Brute Force:
	Nested for loops to evaluate every triplet sum combination.

	Time: O(n^3)
	Space: O(1)

Optimal:
	First, sort input list.
	Iterate over sorted list of numbers, then use Two Sum sorted solution on remaining list.
		Use two pointers: 1 at the start of the string, 1 at the end.
		Increment and decrement pointers until they meet or cross.
		If `sum > target`, decrement right pointer.
		If `sum < target`, increment left pointer.

	Duplicate triplets are not allowed, so if first index is the same as the previous
		first index, then continue.
	For inner Two Sum calculation, if second index is the same as the previous
		second index, then continue.

	Time: O(nlogn + n^2) = O(n^2)
	Space: O(1) or O(n) = O(n)
		-  Depends on sorting algorithm
