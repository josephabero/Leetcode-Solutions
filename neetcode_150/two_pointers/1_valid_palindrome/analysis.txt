Valid Palindrome
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome

Brute Force:
	Create copy of string and remove non-alphanumeric characters.
	Create a copy of the resulting string, but reverse the string.
	Compare string and reversed string, if the same then it is a palindrome.

	Time: O(n)
	Space: O(2n) = O(n)

Optimal:
	Use two pointers: 1 at the start of the string, 1 at the end.
	Increment and decrement pointers until they meet or cross.
	Skip non-alphanumeric characters and only compare as lowercase.
	Repeat until pointers cross or character doesn't match.

	NOTE: To create custom `isalnum()` function, use ASCII characters:
		ord('A') <= ord(c) <= ord('Z') or
        ord('a') <= ord(c) <= ord('z') or
        ord('0') <= ord(c) <= ord('9')

	Time: O(n)
	Space: O(1)
