Two Sum II: Input Array Is Sorted
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted

Brute Force:
	Nested for loops to evaluate every sum combination.

	Time: O(n^2)
	Space: O(1)

Optimal:
	Use two pointers: 1 at the start of the string, 1 at the end.
	Increment and decrement pointers until they meet or cross.
	If `sum > target`, decrement right pointer.
	If `sum < target`, increment left pointer.

	Can use this approach because the input is sorted, therefore, we don't
		need to consider later indexes as the sum is already larger than
		the target for the minimum sum combination.

	Time: O(n)
	Space: O(1)
