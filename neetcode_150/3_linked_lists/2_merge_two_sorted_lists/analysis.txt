Merge Two Sorted Lists
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists

Optimal:
	Use 2 pointers: dummy 'head' node and current.
	Initialize current to head.
	Iterate through both lists together.
		Choose lower value, then increment corresponding list pointer.
		Must manage rearranging of pointers.
			1. Set current.next to lower valued node (Attaches node to result list)
			2. Set current to node
			3. Set current.next to None (Detaches node from input linked list)

	Return head.next to ignore dummy node

	Time: O(m + n)
	Space: O(1)
