Copy List with Random Pointer
https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer

Optimal:
	2-Pass ALgoirthm:
		1. First Pass to copy nodes and cache node-to-random mapping
		2. Second Pass to assign copied 'next' and 'random' pointers to copied nodes.

	Mapping:
		{
			Node 1 From Initial List: Copied Node 1,
			Node 2 From Initial List: Copied Node 2,
		}

	Notes to consider:
		- Only need 1 current pointer (Copy pointer used in 2nd pass)
		- Must perform safe gets for 'None' lookups in 2nd pass & return

	Time: O(n)
	Space: O(n)
