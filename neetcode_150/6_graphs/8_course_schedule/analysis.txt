https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule

Optimal:
	Create adjacency list from prerequisites and perform DFS on adjacency list.
	If there is a cycle found in the graph, then it is not possible to complete the courses.

	Time: O(V + E)
		- Time complexity to perform DFS
	Space: O(V + E)
		- Space complexity of adjacency list
