Same Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/

Optimal:
	Iterate through both trees together:

	Trees are not the same if:
		- Number of nodes differs or
		- Any node's values differ

	If we traverse through the entirety of both trees and there are no differences,
	then they are the same trees.

	Time: O(n)
	Space: O(log(n))
