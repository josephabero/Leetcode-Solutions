Diameter of Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/

Optimal:
	Perform DFS to iterate through each node.

	At each node, calculate max_diameter:
		- Use helper function to perform DFS
		- Allows us to save max_diameter as we traverse via recursion

		max_diameter = current max vs (left + right + 2)

	Base Case:
		Treat null children as -1
		Treat leaf nodes as 0

	As we bubble up from recursion, return the max diameter between the child nodes
		max(left, right)


	Time: O(n)
	Space: O(log(n))
