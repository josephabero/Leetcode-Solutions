Invert Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree

Optimal:
    - Perform DFS to reach leaf node
        - Swap Left & Right nodes

    Space Complexity is determined by maximum number of recursive calls.
        - This is the maximum depth of the binary tree

                    A
                B       C
              D   E   F   G

        - For a binary tree, it's guaranteed to be log(n) depth.
        - Therefore, there will be log(n) recursive calls to reach a leaf node (i.e. 'D' node)

    Time: O(n)
    Space: O(log(n))
