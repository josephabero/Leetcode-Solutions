Maximum Depth Of Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree

Optimal:
	- Perform DFS to reach leaf nodes.
		- Count depth as we return back up to root node

		Example Tree:
		            A
                B       C
              D   E   F   G

        Counts:
		            3
                2       1
              1   1

        Space Complexity is determined by maximum number of recursive calls.
        - For a binary tree, it's guaranteed to be log(n) depth.

	Time: O(n)
	Space: O(log(n))
