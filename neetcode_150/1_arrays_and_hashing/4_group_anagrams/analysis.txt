Group Anagrams
https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams

Brute Force:
	Use hashmap, iterate through each input string, sort characters.
	Use characters as key for hashmap and insert into list.

	m = number of input strings
	n = max length of input string

	Time: O(m  * nlog(n))
	Space: O(n)

Optimal:
	Use hashmap, iterate through each input string.
	Count number of characters in alphabet & encode that as key.
	For example: "tea" = 1t 1e 1a = 10001000000000000001000000

	m = number of input strings
	n = max length of input string
	26 = length of key list

	Time: O(m * n * 26) = O(m * n)
	Space: O(m * n)
