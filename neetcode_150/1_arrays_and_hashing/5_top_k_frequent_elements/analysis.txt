Top K Frequent Elements
https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/

Brute Force:
	Use hashmap to gather counts of each character.
	Sort by number of occurrences or use heap to order by number of occurrences.
	Heap would pop k times (O(log(n)) for each pop)

	Time: O(nlog(n)) or O(klog(n)) for heap
	Space: O(2n) = O(n)

Optimal:
	Use hashmap to gather counts of each character.
	Use bucket sort idea to group same number of occurrences together.
		nums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
		sorted = [[], [3,  4], [1, 1], [], [], [], []]

	Iterate through sorted list of lists in reverse order and get k elements.

	Time: O(n)
	Space: O(2n) = O(n)
