Search a 2D Matrix
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix

Brute Force:
	Iterate through each row in the matrix.
	Perform binary search if row is valid range of values.

	Time: O(mlog(n))
	Space: O(1)

Optimal:
	Rows are sorted and the first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

	2 major steps:
		1. Use binary search to find row with valid range of target values
		2. Perform binary search once row is found

	Perform binary search on the matrix lists (top & bottom pointers).
		Use the first and last values in the middle row to determine how to
		adjust the indexes.
			- If last value is larget than target, move top pointer
			- If first value is smaller than target, move bottom pointer
			- Else, row with valid range is found

	Perform normal binary search on row.

	Time: O(log(m) + log(n)) = O(log(m + n))
	Space: O(1)
