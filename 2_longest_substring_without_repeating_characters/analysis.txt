Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters

Brute Force:
	Keep 2 indices and use 2 for loops to iterate through each char.
	Keep int of longest index as you iterate.

	Time: O(n^2)
	Space: O(n)


Optimal:
	Sliding Intervals:
		- Keep 2 indices, iterate through once
		- If duplicate char found, adjust interval window
		- Can either use lookup table or substring


	Time: O(n)
	Space: O(min(m, n)) where m is the set of non-duplicate characters
