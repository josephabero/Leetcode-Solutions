Container With The Most Water
https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water

Brute Force:
	2 For Loops and iterate through each height
	Use 2 pointers to calculate every area and keep the largest area

	Time: O(n^2)
	Space: O(1)

Optimal:
	1 pass loop
	Keep 2 pointers: Left and Right
	Take the minimum height between the 2 and use the difference for width
	Calculate area and compare to max. Move pointer with shorter height.
	Move pointers closer to each other until max is found.

	Time: O(n)
	Space: O(1)
