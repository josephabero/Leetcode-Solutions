Longest Palindromic Substring
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/

Brute Force:
	Keep 2 indices: Left and Right.
	Iterate over every character and evaluate if each substring is palindrome.
	To evaluate a palindrome, reverse string and compare that it is the same.

	Time: O(n^3)
	Space: O(1)
		- Worst case is holding 2 strings with length of input string


Optimal:
	Keep 2 indices: Left and Right.
	Iterate over each character in input string.
	Treat each character is center of palindrome and expand around that index while keeping track of longest palindrome.
	Must handle odd vs even palindrome lengths


	Time: O(n^2)
	Space: O(1)
