Valid Parentheses
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/

Brute Force:
	N/A	

Optimal:
	Use hash for given brackets
	Iterate over input string and use stack to keep track of bracket pairs:
		Add to stack if open bracket
		If closed bracket, pop off stack and make sure it's matching bracket.
	Handle special cases of odd length string and leftover open brackets.

	m is size of open parentheses

	Time: O(n)
	Space: O(m)
