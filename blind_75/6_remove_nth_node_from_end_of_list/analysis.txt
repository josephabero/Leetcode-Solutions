Remove Nth Node From End of List
https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/

m = length of linked list

Brute Force:

	m = length of linked list
	Time: O(2m - n) = O(m)
	Space: O(1)

Optimal:
	2 pointers: fast & slow
	Iterate fast pointer to nth node (creates diff between fast and slow pointer)
	Iterate together.
	Handle case where length == n, remove head and return rest of list.

	Alternate solution: recursively iterate to end of list


	m = length of linked list
	Time: O(m)
	Space: O(m)
