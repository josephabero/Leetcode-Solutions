Merge Two Sorted Lists
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/

Optimal:
	Can be done iteratively or recursively.
	Use 2 pointers, 1 to keep head of resulting list, 2nd to keep track of tail of resulting list.

	Iterate over both lists: O(m + n)
	Add nodes to end of list

	Considerations:
		- Initialize 0 node for resulting list, can return list after the first node
		- Can break loop early and add rest of the input list to the end of the resulting list.

	Time: O(m + n)
	Space: O(1)
